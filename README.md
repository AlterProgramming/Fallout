Small game with custom game engine in JS + Canvas rendering.
Showcases OOP design along with event driven architecture.

Rules are simple:
. You can only move left right by default
. Press O to activate free flight that lets you move in all direction for a short time
. Press P to slow down time on all active blocks and allow for a quick escape.
. Pause with ESC
. Game gets progressively harder the higher the score.

Enjoy!!
