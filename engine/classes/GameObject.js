/**
 * A game object class.
 * Everything in each scene needs to be contained inside a game object.
 * At a high level a game object usually represents a "thing" in the game, e.g.
 * a score display, an enemy, a health bar, etc.
 * 
 * A game objects primary job is to have a list of components. As a result, there
 * is not a lot of logic in this class. 
 * 
 * Notes: 
 * 
 * Unlike `Scene` and `Transform`, you can directly instantiate this class, i.e.
 * `new GameObject("Slug")` is fine.
 * 
 * All major functions that get passed through to the components, e.g. `start`, 
 * have a reference to the current rendering context. This allows your components
 * to check the screen size, etc., in functions other than `draw()`
